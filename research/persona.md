# Target Persona: SaaS Account Executive (Mid-Market / Enterprise)
**Profile**: Mid-market to enterprise SaaS AE (2–8 years exp, $150k–$400k OTE).  
**Context (Feb 2026)**: Operating in a tougher macro with longer sales cycles, higher buyer scrutiny, quota pressure (avg attainment ~43–60%), and heavy AI layering on classic tools. Many teams stack Gong/Clari/Outreach (~$200–500/user/mo) but face adoption friction, context-switching burnout, and inconsistent AI outputs.

## Daily Actions and Workflows
- Reviewing pipeline/deal stages in CRM (often with AI-generated health scores or summaries)
- Conducting discovery calls, demos, and objection handling
- Writing/sending personalized follow-ups and internal updates
- Updating CRM after every interaction (manual tweaks still common despite AI)
- Researching prospects/accounts before calls (hyper-personalization expected)
- Preparing tailored proposals, pricing, and ROI stories
- Coordinating with SDRs, SEs, CS, legal, and champions
- Attending forecast meetings (now often AI-assisted but still manual roll-ups in many orgs)
- Negotiating contracts, chasing signatures, multi-threading deals
- Juggling 8–12 tools daily → high context-switching

## Current Tools Stack (2026 Reality)
- **CRM**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive (core)
- **Revenue Intelligence / Forecasting**: Clari, Gong (often bundled), People.ai
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Gong, Chorus.ai, ZoomInfo Fathom
- **Sales Engagement / Sequences**: Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo
- **Email & Calendar**: Gmail/Outlook, Google Calendar
- **Video / Calls**: Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
- **Prospecting / Enrichment**: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clay
- **Proposals / eSign**: PandaDoc, DocuSign
- **Enablement / Content**: Highspot, Seismic
- **AI Overlays / Copilots**: ChatGPT/Claude wrappers, internal copilots, emerging AI-native platforms
- **Comms**: Slack/Teams (heavy internal deal status pings)

## Ultimate Goals (Beyond Day-to-Day)
- Consistently hit/exceed quota in a 43–60% attainment environment
- Become a trusted strategic advisor (not just a seller)
- Advance to Sr. AE, Enterprise AE, or leadership
- Build referral networks and long-term expansion pipeline
- Minimize admin to maximize selling time
- Develop vertical/industry expertise
- Achieve sustainable work-life balance amid burnout risk

## Complete Workflow: Lead → Closed-Won
1. Receive qualified lead from SDR/marketing
2. Deep research: company (news, funding, tech stack), contact (LinkedIn, role changes)
3. Review handoff notes/context
4. Prep discovery agenda/questions
5. Schedule/send pre-call materials
6. Run discovery call
7. Capture/review notes (AI summary + manual verification)
8. Update CRM (notes, stage, next steps)
9. Send personalized follow-up email
10. Map/engage buying committee
11. Prep tailored demo (with SE coordination)
12. Run demo/presentation
13. Follow-up with case studies/ROI materials
14. Handle objections (email/call)
15. Build/send proposal/quote
16. Navigate procurement/legal reviews
17. Negotiate terms/pricing
18. Chase signatures/blockers
19. Close → handoff to CS
20. Update CRM, request referrals/testimonials
21. Nurture for expansion

## Key Manual Touchpoints & Mini-Tasks
- Copy-pasting LinkedIn/org data into CRM
- Multi-tab research for hyper-personalized outreach
- Drafting variant follow-ups repeatedly
- Manual CRM updates (AI summaries often need fixes)
- Searching old emails/threads for context
- Building pricing proposals from scratch
- Tracking multi-threaded stakeholders
- Managing follow-up reminders across tools
- Finding matching case studies
- Reviewing AI call summaries (miss nuance/hallucinate)
- Exporting/formatting forecast data
- Answering repetitive Slack status questions
- Coordinating schedules/timezones
- Version-controlling contract redlines

## Top Pain Points (2026 Edition – 22 Prioritized)
1. **45–60+ min research per discovery call** — tabs + AI summaries needing verification for hyper-personalization.

20. **Handoff context loss** from SDR → redundant discovery.
21. **AI/tool fatigue** — juggling 8–12 platforms, inconsistent outputs, burnout.
22. **Quota pressure in tough macro** — longer cycles, budget scrutiny, many missing targets.
